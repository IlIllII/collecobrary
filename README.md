<h2 id="about">ðŸ’¡ About</h2>

The idea for this project spawned from my own frustration with the online learning landscape. Finding quality courses is like searching for needles in haystacks. Hopefully this can make it a little bit easier to find a quality learning path.


<h2 id="resources">ðŸ§­ Resources</h2>

If you are trying to find good courses, here are some places to look:

- OCW - A lot of OCW is pretty old and incomplete, but [MIT](https://ocw.mit.edu/index.htm), [Yale](https://oyc.yale.edu/courses), and [UCI](http://ocw.uci.edu/) seem to have pretty good OCW still.
- Youtube Channels - A lot of universities and professors post lectures on youtube. [Stanford](https://www.youtube.com/c/stanford/playlists) is a good example.
- [Berkeley Webcasts](https://wiki.archiveteam.org/index.php/UC_Berkeley_Course_Captures) - Massive archive of lecture recordings from before 2017 when they stopped doing them.
- University departments - Often you can find course websites online and some of them may have complete materials, such as [Kellis Lab at MIT](http://compbio.mit.edu/compbio.html). Additionally, sometimes professors will post their courses on their personal websites.

Generally I have found that the MOOCs and other "learning platforms" have courses that are pretty poor quality, but that's just my opinion.

Good luck!
