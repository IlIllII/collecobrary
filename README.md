  We are making degree roadmaps comprised of 100% free, high quality online courses for self-study.

  It is very much in its infancy. As such, it could really use your help and input.

<h2 id="about">ðŸ’¡ About</h2>

The idea for this project spawned from my own frustration with the current online learning landscape. Finding quality courses is like searching for needles in haystacks. Hopefully this can make it a little bit easier to find a quality learning path.


<h2 id="resources">ðŸ§­ Resources</h2>

If you are trying to find good courses, here are some places to look:

- OCW - A lot of OCW is pretty old and incomplete, but [MIT](https://ocw.mit.edu/index.htm), [Yale](https://oyc.yale.edu/courses), and [UCI](http://ocw.uci.edu/) seem to have pretty good OCW still.
- Youtube Channels - A lot of universities and professors post lectures on youtube. [Stanford](https://www.youtube.com/c/stanford/playlists) is a good example.
- [Berkeley Webcasts](https://wiki.archiveteam.org/index.php/UC_Berkeley_Course_Captures) - Massive archive of lecture recordings from before 2017 when they stopped doing them.
- University departments - Often you can find course websites online and some of them may have complete materials, such as [Kellis Lab at MIT](http://compbio.mit.edu/compbio.html). Additionally, sometimes professors will post their courses on their personal websites.

Generally I have found that the MOOCs and other "learning platforms" have courses that are pretty poor quality, but that's just my opinion.

Good luck!
