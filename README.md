<h4 align="center">MOOCs suck, OCW's outdated, and microcredentials are predatory.</h4>

<p align="center">
  We are making degree roadmaps comprised of 100% free, high quality online courses for self-study.

  It is very much in its infancy. As such, it could really use your help and input.

<h2 id="quickstart">âš¡ Quickstart</h2>


If it is your first time contributing, you might want to see [contributing](#contributing) to get a sense of the project first before starting.

### Project setup

#### First, clone the repo and install dependencies:
```
git clone https://github.com/nietsymerej/collecobrary.git
cd collecobrary
npm install
```

#### Now you are ready to go. To run the server in development mode:
```
npm run serve
```

This will run the server on localhost:8080 and provide hot-reloads when saving files.

#### To compile and minify for production:
```
npm run build
```

#### To run the linter:
```
npm run lint
```

Once everything checks out locally, you can merge your pull request with the master to redeploy the live website. We can set up a test server later if we need to.

<h2 id="about">ðŸ’¡ About</h2>

The idea for this project spawned from my own frustration with the current online learning landscape. As [Reich and RuipÃ©rez-Valiente](https://www.umt.edu/provost/docs/MOOC-pivot.pdf) point out, some online education platforms have massive audiences, which signals that there is quite a demand for online education. Yet, according to the article, user retention rates are ultra low.

<div align="center">
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/78166995/136632980-cdc27747-8ab8-4fdb-9d21-62d2c7564406.PNG"></img>
</div>

According to my own research, this is because MOOCs are shit, as are many other resources. Detailing all of the ways in which every platform is lacking would take ages, but at a high level I have 3 criticisms:

### Three problems this project aims to solve

1. **Poor quality.** Many platforms have high variability when it comes to course quality, and many courses designed for online learners are significantly dumbed down.
2. **Too many choices.** Some platforms provide thousands of courses. We don't need 100 different Calc I courses; the top three will suffice.
3. **No structure or progression.** It is hard to know what you don't know, and many platforms don't lay out equivalencies, prerequisites, or roadmaps guiding students through broad subjects, making it difficult to come up with a study plan.

While some existing products contain one or two of these elements, none has all three. The goal of this project is to create a free resource that satisfies this trilemma. I have made a start, but with a little help it could be so much better.

<h2 id="resources">ðŸ§­ Resources</h2>

If you are trying to find good courses, here are some places to look:

- OCW - A lot of OCW is pretty old and incomplete, but [MIT](https://ocw.mit.edu/index.htm), [Yale](https://oyc.yale.edu/courses), and [UCI](http://ocw.uci.edu/) seem to have pretty good OCW still.
- Youtube Channels - A lot of universities and professors post lectures on youtube. [Stanford](https://www.youtube.com/c/stanford/playlists) is a good example.
- [Berkeley Webcasts](https://wiki.archiveteam.org/index.php/UC_Berkeley_Course_Captures) - Massive archive of lecture recordings from before 2017 when they stopped doing them.
- University departments - Often you can find course websites online and some of them may have complete materials, such as [Kellis Lab at MIT](http://compbio.mit.edu/compbio.html). Additionally, sometimes professors will post their courses on their personal websites, particularly if the course is high quality.

Generally I have found that the MOOCs and other "learning platforms" have courses that are pretty poor quality, but this is just one man's opinion.

Good luck!
