**The goal of this project is to make online learning easy and fun by presenting the best free online courses in an appealing and intuitive way.**

It is very much in its infancy. As such, it could really use your help and input.

The idea for this project spawned from my own frustration with the current online learning landscape. It can be very challenging to find and organize quality materials. I have found some very helpful roadmaps, but even these can be lacking or limited to a narrow domain.
