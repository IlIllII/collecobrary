# collecobrary

**Website presenting university degree roadmaps that contain 100% online, free college courses.**

The idea of this project is to present a collection of college courses sourced from OCW and university course webpages.

This repo is a webpage mostly geared toward the visualization aspects of the project. I made the curricula digraph visualization using d3. My other repo, curated-courses, contains other content of the website and was actually a past version. Sometime in the future I may marry these two projects to make a fully functional website.
