# Contributing

Thanks for taking the time to get involved! Feel free to contribute as much or as little as you want - even a little bit helps. Here you will find everything you need to know about getting started with the project. If you have any questions, comments, or feedback don't hesitate to reach out on [Discord](https://discord.gg/fbbYhvkaBx) (you can also drop by just to say hi!).


## Primary ways to help

### Getting in touch

If you have any thoughts, please share them! You can send a message on discord or start a discussion in this repo.

### Contributing courses

The idea for the project is present collections of extremely high quality, free, college level courses to self-directed learners. If you happen to know of a great course, please share it so it can be included. If you are savvy enough you can add this into the data files yourself, otherwise just open an issue and I'll add it to the digraph.

The main things we are looking for in a course is the following:

1. Free (it is better if you don't need to make an account to access)
2. Accurate information
3. Ideally course materials would be complete and include videos, readings, and homework assignments
4. The course should be interesting enough to complete without anyone making you do it
5. Recent courses are better if the field is fast moving
6. Lecture videos should be longer than 30 minutes and readings should be more than a paragraph.
7. Bonus points for credible providers such as Stanford or MIT

We generally try to avoid MOOCs, but we can make exceptions for exceptional cases.

### Technical users

If you are a developer you can contribute by building features. There is a long list of things that would be useful, so if you have an idea feel free to jump right in. Below you can find instructions on how to get started with the project. If you want to get involved but are unsure of where to start, jump into the discord and we can talk through some things.
